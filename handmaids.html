                    The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood is a story about a woman named Offred in
                    a scary future where a strict religious group called Gilead rules America. Women have no freedom,
                    and Offred is a Handmaid, forced to have babies for a powerful man, the Commander, and his wife,
                    Serena Joy. She lives under tight control, always watched, and remembers her old life with her
                    husband and daughter, who were taken away.

                    Offred carefully talks to other Handmaids and gets close to Nick, the Commander’s driver, which is dangerous. She also learns about a secret group fighting Gilead. When her actions are found out, she’s taken away, and we don’t know if she’s saved or in trouble. The story, told by Offred, shows her struggle to stay strong in a cruel world.

                    <p>
                        Patriarchy is a social system built upon unequal power relations that men maintain over
                        women. In “The Handmaid’s Tale”, patriarchy is a theme that illustrates Gilead’s social structure,
                        the oppressive control men exert over women, and how it devalues women of their reproductive
                        roles, individuality, and basic rights. Men held all political, social, and economic power, while
                        women were categorized by their roles, eg, wives, marthas, and handmaids, each with a specific role.
                        The handmaids, for instance, were reduced to their ability to bear children and were seen as
                        instruments of procreation, while the wives were valued for their obedience to their husbands
                        and the ability to run their households. The novel also highlights religious patriarchy in the
                        sense that roles for men and women were shaped around biblical ideas of gender. For instance, in
                        the bible where a slave or servant would perform the role of a concubine, with the resulting
                        children being considered as part of another woman. In Gilead, women are stripped of their
                        economic, political, and reproductive rights which aligns to the situations in our societies
                        where women face discrimination in employment, limited access to education and restrictions in
                        their bodily rights for example, child marriages, forced marriages and lack of access to abortion
                        services are real life manifestations of control over women’s lives.

                        In the book ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’, the concept of fear is exposed in many occasions amongst
                        the young women, who were only for the role of surrogacy, within the oppressive society of
                        Gilead. Today, even in the contrast of societal settings between Gilead and current society, the
                        concept of fear is still portrayed in many aspects. The Gilead setting was that, in any case of
                        deviation from expected moral conduct, such as trying to escape from designated bounds and
                        committing adultery, heavy punishments, which are: breaking of legs and being hung publicly
                        respectively for the above cases, were executed on the victims, not only to stop them from
                        messing up again but also to send out a warning to the rest, who seemed to be lucky not to be
                        in that situation for the moment. Current society reveals fear in almost similar circumstances
                        of unfair treatment yet choosing to move on in silence. For example the fear to lose one’s job
                        because of complaints to unfair work conditions, the fear of imprisonment because of criticism
                        to prevailing authorities and this can even include death cases and cases of abduction, fear of
                        religious leaders who tend to threaten their audiences with disastrous experiences for violation
                        of any instructions, among other fears.

                        In the Handmaid's Tale, power is the main issue. Gilead’s leaders control everyone,
                        especially women. The government, run mostly by men, takes away people's freedom to keep
                        itself in charge. Women like Offred, a Handmaid, are treated like objects, given names like
                        “Of Fred” to show they belong to their commanders. They can’t make their own choices, and
                        harsh punishments, like public hangings, scare them into obeying. Gilead also uses spies,
                        called the Eyes, who watch everyone’s every move, making people afraid to speak out or act
                        against the rules. But not everyone gives in. Off      </p>

                    <p>
                        In “The Handmaid's Tale”, religion is one of the main means of control used by Gilead. Where
                        the society was heavily influenced by interpretation of the bible. Gilead claims to promote
                        christianity values such as charity and forgiveness, while in reality these values are
                        distorted and used as a way to promote the oppression of women. In the book, people in power
                        use certain passages from the bible like the phrase “Blessed be the fruit” which is used as
                        a greeting among handmaids, underscores their sole purpose of reproduction, reducing their
                        identity to their biological function.

                        This is also still a big issue in today’s society, where because of religion women are
                        manipulated to believe they are only meant for some things not the other, mainly in African
                        societies like Rwanda specifically where some churches prohibit women from doing certain
                        roles, or having certain rights like how the bible says women should be submissive. This is
                        used in today’s world to manipulate women into believing they are meant to be just house
                        wives who respect and do whatever men say in the form of being respectful to men no matter
                        how badly they are treated.

                    <p>
                        In The Handmaid’s Tale the concept of loss of agency refers to the systematic stripping away
                        of individual autonomy and freedom, particularly women within the oppressive society of
                        Gilead. Gilead’s regime controls women’s bodies, identities, and decision-making ability by
                        reducing them to vessels for procreation and instruments of state control. Women are
                        categorized as the handmaids (Tasked with reproduction only), the Marthas (tasked with doing
                        the house chores), and the Elites (wives to the commanders). The handmaids are assigned to
                        reproduce for the Elites, stripped of their personal freedom and forced to engage in sexual
                        acts for procreation. The Marthas, Aunts, and Wives are subjected to varying degrees of
                        control and restriction, lacking autonomy in their lives. This shows the complete absence of
                        reproductive rights for women in Gilead, who are not allowed to make decisions about their
                        own bodies or future pregnancies. Gilead systematically eliminates individual names and
                        identities, replacing them with assigned roles that reinforce the societal hierarchy. Women
                        are denied access to education, employment, and personal property, further limiting their
                        capacity for independent thought and action. Gilead’s color-coded attire and strict rules
                        regarding appearance further emphasize the suppression of individual expression and identity.
                        The women are novice in political decisions or the legal system. Even seemingly mundane
                        aspects of daily life, like shopping or travel, are controlled by others. The threat of
                        severe punishment for any deviation from the prescribed rules reinforces the lack of agency
                        and fosters a climate of fear and compliance. While women in Gilead are largely powerless,
                        the novel also explores subtle forms of resistance such as maintaining personal memories,
                        relationships, or acts of defiance. The novel’s narration by Offred highlights the
                        importance of language as a means of resistance and maintaining a sense of self. Even in the
                        face of immense oppression, the characters hold on to a glimmer of hope for escape and a
                        future where they can exercise their agency.

                        The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood is a story about a woman named Offred in a scary future
                        where a strict religious group called Gilead rules America. Women have no freedom, and Offred is
                        a Handmaid, forced to have babies for a powerful man, the Commander, and his wife, Serena Joy.
                        She lives under tight control, always watched, and remembers her old life with her husband and
                        daughter, who were taken away. Offred carefully talks to other Handmaids and gets close to Nick,
                        the Commander’s driver, which is dangerous. She also learns about a secret group fighting
                        Gilead. When her actions are found out, she’s taken away, and we don’t know if she’s saved or in
                        trouble. The story, told by Offred, shows her struggle to stay strong in a cruel world.
