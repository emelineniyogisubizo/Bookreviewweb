                <h2>Poverty and inequality</h2>
                <p>Noah's upbringing in marginalized<br>
                     communities reveals the cyclical <br>
                     nature of poverty and its impact on<br>
                      individuals and communities . System<br>
                       oppression can lead to limited opportunities<br>
                        and perpetuation of poverty, echoing ongoing <br>
                        struggles faced by vulnerable populations in various<br>

                <h2>Identity, Belonging, and Community</h2>
                <p>Trevor Noah's Born a Crime dives into the<br>
                     struggle to find identity and belonging in a <br>
                     divided South Africa. In Chapter 15, Trevor's <br>
                     shoplifting with friends highlights this. As a mixed-race<br>
                      kid, apartheid's strict race categories -black, white, <br>
                      coloured-leave him with no clear place. Society's old <br>
                      traditions also press hard: women like his mom, Patricia, <br>
                      are supposed to follow men like Abel, even though she pays<br>
                       the bills. Apartheid's rules on jobs and homes make things <br>
                       tougher, keeping black families trapped with little money. Trevor's <br>
                       shoplifting group becomes his community, welcoming him despite his<br>
                        “crime” of being mixed. They share dangers and gains, like the “Black tax”. <br>
                        In my community although kids get labeled as rich, poor, and geek but groups like <br>
                        teams build connections. Around the world, mixed-race people in the U.S. also face<br>
                         the “where do you belong?” question. Trevor's crew proves that the community can <br>
                         overcome being left out.</p>

                <h2>Apartheid's Lasting Barriers</h2>
                <p>Apartheid's impact still hangs over Born a Crime,<br>
                     affecting everyone's personal and social fights. For <br>
                     example, Trevor's bus driver in Chapter 17 drives without<br>
                      a license to make money, knowing he could get arrested because <br>
                      apartheid's rules blocked black people from good jobs.  These rules<br>
                       kept black South Africans stuck in townships, and even after apartheid<br>
                        was gone, chances to get ahead were few. Old-school expectations made things<br>
                         tougher-women like Patricia were supposed to focus on family, often helping men<br>
                          like Abel, whose garage didn't work out. Apartheid's separation split communities,<br>
                          leaving them clueless about each other's lives. Still, Trevor's hard work builds a<br>
                           group with other drivers, sharing ways to avoid cops, a bit like the “Black tax,”<br>
                            where those doing well help those who aren't. In my town, schools in minority areas<br>
                             get less money, showing this gap, and in the U.S., housing differences are similar. <br>
                             Trevor's story proves that communities give a sense of belonging despite systems <br>
                             that push people out. </p>
