                <h1>About the book</h1>
                <p>Trevor Noah's Born a Crime is a memoir about growing up in South Africa during the end of apartheid.
                    Born to a Black
                    mother and White father, his mixed-race birth was illegal, making him an outsider from the start.
                    The ook tells stories
                    of his life in tough neighborhoods, dealing with poverty, prejudice, and violence. His bold, loving
                    mom, Patricia, guides
                    him with lessons on resilience and independence. With humor and heart, Noah shares
                    how he navigated a divided society, offering a moving look at family, identity, and finding hope in
                    hard times.</p>

            <h2>Personal Reflection</h2>
            <p id="book-quote">"Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a
                traditional wife… but he never fell in love with subservient women… 'He only wants a woman who is free
                because his dream is to put her in a cage.'”</p>
            <br>
            <p>This line grabbed me—it’s not just Abel’s story. It’s about how guys and girls connect today.</p>
            <h3>Abel’s Mixed-Up Wants</h3>

            <p>Abel loves Patricia’s strength—she’s tough, smart, and does her own thing. But he also wants her to act
                like a “classic” wife, following his lead. That “cage” part? It means he likes her freedom but wants to
                control it. I see this now. Some guys online say they want a cool, driven girlfriend but get upset if
                she’s too busy with her own goals. My friend’s boyfriend bragged about her dance skills but got mad when
                she practiced late, saying she didn’t “care enough.” It’s like wanting a star but dimming her light.</p>
            <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
            <p>The quote shows old ideas about guys and girls can hurt people. Abel’s need to be in charge turns ugly,
                breaking their family. We still see this—guys expected to be “the boss,” girls to “help out.” It’s
                messy. Patricia’s fight to stay herself makes me want love that’s fair, where no one’s trapped.</p>

                <h2>If I Could Rename The Book</h2>
                <p>If I could give the book a title I would have named it <span id="book-name">Stuck Between,Still
                        Strong </span></p>
                <h3>Why this name</h3>
                <p>This title shows Trevor’s life—caught between black and white worlds in apartheid South Africa, never
                    quite fitting in, but always pushing through with guts and laughs. “Stuck Between” covers how he’s
                    seen as “wrong” for being mixed-race, like when he hides his mom’s role or hustles to get by. “Still
                    Strong” highlights how he stays true to himself, becoming a bold voice. It’s short and catchy, not
                    too close to “Born a Crime,” and feels like a blog headline. I picked it because it sums up Trevor’s
                    vibe in a simple way that stands out from usual titles.</p>
