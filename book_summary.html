<h2>REASON FOR THE TITLE:</h2>
<P>Reason for the Title "Invisible Lines":
    I chose Invisible Lines because it captures the hidden barriers and divisions that shaped Trevor Noah’s life under apartheid. Although the laws of segregation were written and enforced, the real impact was felt in the unspoken, invisible rules that dictated where he could go, who he could love, and how he could live. These "lines" weren't always visible — they existed in people’s minds, in fears, and in societal structures that separated races, communities, and even families.
    The book also narrates Noah's struggles alone and the battles he face without the knowledge of his mother.
    Throughout Born a Crime, Trevor navigates these invisible boundaries daily, constantly adapting to survive. The title reflects both the literal and metaphorical barriers that, while unseen, powerfully controlled his existence.</P>

<p>
    The quote, "Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife… but he never fell in love with subservient women… 'He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage,'" captures a contradiction that still exists in many relationships today. It speaks to a deep tension between admiration and control — wanting the strength and independence of a partner, but also wanting to limit it.
In modern society, gender roles are evolving rapidly. Women are increasingly encouraged to be independent, career-driven, outspoken, and autonomous. However, some traditional expectations around relationships persist, where men (or even society at large) still expect women to be nurturing, accommodating, and to prioritize the relationship or family over their personal ambitions. Abel’s mindset — wanting a "free" woman only to try and cage her — reflects an ongoing societal struggle: the desire for partnership with strong individuals, coupled with discomfort when those individuals act independently.
For example, many successful women today still report facing backlash in dating. Some are told they are "too intimidating" or "too ambitious." There are unspoken pressures for women to "dim their light" to make a man feel more comfortable or to conform to more traditional roles once they enter serious relationships or marriage. This dynamic isn't limited to romantic relationships either — it echoes in workplaces and families, where women may be celebrated for their achievements but expected to compromise them once they take on roles like wife or mother.
 It is a  double standard that suggests a woman’s value is tied to her ability to adapt to someone else's expectations rather than her right to maintain her freedom.
However, there is also a growing movement that challenges these outdated norms. More people now seek true partnerships — relationships based on mutual respect, shared growth, and the celebration of each other’s independence. The healthiest relationships today are often those where neither person feels the need to control the other but instead supports their individuality.
Abel’s desire to "put her in a cage" serves as a warning: love that seeks to control is not truly love. True love cherishes freedom — it doesn’t seek to steal it.
