                    The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood is a story about a woman named Offred in
                    a scary future where a strict religious group called Gilead rules America. Women have no freedom,
                    and Offred is a Handmaid, forced to have babies for a powerful man, the Commander, and his wife,
                    Serena Joy. She lives under tight control, always watched, and remembers her old life with her
                    husband and daughter, who were taken away. Offred carefully talks to other Handmaids and gets close
                    to Nick, the Commander’s driver, which is dangerous. She also learns about a secret group fighting
                    Gilead. When her actions are found out, she’s taken away, and we don’t know if she’s saved or in
                    trouble. The story, told by Offred, shows her struggle to stay strong in a cruel world.

                        Patriarchy is a social system built upon unequal power relations that men maintain over
                        women.
                        In “The Handmaid’s Tale”, patriarchy is a theme that illustrates Gilead’s social structure,
                        the oppressive control men exert over women, and how it devalues women of their reproductive
                        roles, individuality, and basic rights.

                        Men held all political, social, and economic power, while women were categorized by their
                        roles, eg, wives, marthas, and handmaids, each with a specific role.
                        The handmaids, for instance, were reduced to their ability to bear children and were seen as
                        instruments of procreation, while the wives were valued for their obedience to their
                        husbands and the ability to run their households.

                        The novel also highlights religious patriarchy in the sense that roles for men and women
                        were shaped around biblical ideas of gender. For instance, in the bible where a slave or
                        servant would perform the role of a concubine, with the resulting children being considered
                        as part of another woman.

                        In Gilead, women are stripped of their economic, political, and reproductive rights which
                        aligns to the situations in our societies where women face discrimination in employment,
                        limited access to education and restrictions in their bodily rights for example, child
                        marriages, forced marriages and lack of access to abortion services are real life
                        manifestations of control over women’s lives.

                        In the book ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’, the concept of fear is exposed in many occasions amongst
                        the young women, who were only for the role of surrogacy, within the oppressive society of
                        Gilead.
                        Today, even in the contrast of societal settings between Gilead and current society, the
                        concept of fear is still portrayed in many aspects.
                        The Gilead setting was that, in any case of deviation from expected moral conduct, such as
                        trying to escape from designated bounds and committing adultery, heavy punishments, which
                        are:breaking of legs and being hung publicly respectively for the above cases, were executed
                        on the victims, not only to stop them from messing up again but also to send out a warning
                        to the rest, who seemed to be lucky not to be in that situation for the moment.
                        Current society reveals fear in almost similar circumstances of unfair treatment yet
                        choosing to move on in silence. For example the fear to lose one’s job because of complaints
                        to unfair work conditions, the fear of imprisonment because of criticism to prevailing
                        authorities and this can even include death cases and cases of abduction, fear of religious
                        leaders who tend to threaten their audiences with disastrous experiences for violation of
                        any instructions, among other fears.

                        In the handmaid's tale, power is the main issue. Gilead’s leaders control everyone,
                        especially women. The government, run mostly by men, takes away people's freedom to keep
                        itself incharge. Women like Offred, a Handmaid are treated like objects, given names like
                        “Of Fred” to show they belong to their commanders. They can’t make their own choices, and
                        harsh punishments, like public hangings, scare them into obeying. Gilead also uses spies,
                        called the Eyes, who watch everyone’s every move, making people afraid to speak out or act
                        against the rules. But not everyone gives in. Offred resists quietly by holding onto her
                        memories and telling her story, keeping her thoughts free even when her life isn’t. Another
                        character, Moira, more openly by escaping, showing that even in a powerful system, people
                        can find ways to push back. The book shows both how power traps people with fear and
                        control, but also how courage, whether quiet or loud, can push back against it.

                        The way power works in the book feels a lot like stuff going on in 2025. In Gilead, men
                        control women’s lives, and today, some places have laws that limit what women can do, like
                        controlling their healthcare choices. It’s not as extreme, but it’s the same idea of taking
                        away freedom. In the book, the Eyes spy on everyone, and now, technology like phones and
                        cameras tracks what we do every day, making it feel like someone’s always watching. Gilead’s
                        leaders use religion to justify their power, and in 2025, some leaders push religious
                        beliefs to make strict rules, saying it’s for everyone’s good when it’s really about
                        control. But just like Offred and Moira, people today don’t just accept it. They resist by
                        speaking out or protesting, fighting to keep their rights and voices, much like Offred’s
                        storytelling or Moira’s escape.

                        In “The Handmaid's Tale”, religion is one of the main means of control used by Gilead. Where
                        the society was heavily influenced by interpretation of the bible. Gilead claims to promote
                        christianity values such as charity and forgiveness, while in reality these values are
                        distorted and used as a way to promote the oppression of women. In the book, people in power
                        use certain passages from the bible like the phrase “Blessed be the fruit” which is used as
                        a greeting among handmaids, underscores their sole purpose of reproduction, reducing their
                        identity to their biological function.

                        This is also still a big issue in today’s society, where because of religion women are
                        manipulated to believe they are only meant for some things not the other, mainly in African
                        societies like Rwanda specifically where some churches prohibit women from doing certain
                        roles, or having certain rights like how the bible says women should be submissive. This is
                        used in today’s world to manipulate women into believing they are meant to be just house
                        wives who respect and do whatever men say in the form of being respectful to men no matter
                        how badly they are treated.

                    <p>

                        In The Handmaid’s Tale the concept of loss of agency refers to the systematic stripping away
                        of individual autonomy and freedom, particularly women within the oppressive society of
                        Gilead.
                        Gilead’s regime controls women’s bodies, identities, and decision-making ability by reducing
                        them to vessels for procreation and instruments of state control.

                        Control of the Body:
                        Women are categorized as the handmaids(Tasked with reproduction only), the Marthas(tasked
                        with doing the house chores), and the Elites (wives to the commanders).
                        The handmaids are assigned to reproduce for the Elites, stripped of their personal freedom
                        and forced to engage in sexual acts for procreation.
                        The Marthas, Aunts and Wives are subjected to varying degrees of control and restriction,
                        lacking autonomy in their lives.
                        This shows the complete absence of reproductive rights for women in Gilead, who are not
                        allowed to make decisions about their own bodies about their own bodies or future
                        pregnancies.

                        Suppression Of Identity:
                        Gilead systematically eliminates individual names and identities, replacing them with
                        assigned roles that reinforce the societal hierarchy.
                        Women are denied access to education,employment, and personal property further limiting
                        their capacity for independent thought and action.
                        Gilead’s color-coded attire and strict rules regarding appearance further emphasize the
                        suppression of individual expression and identity.

                        Limited Decision-Making power:
                        The women are novice in political decisions or the legal system.
                        Even seemingly mundane aspects of daily life, like shopping or travel, are controlled by
                        others.
                        The threat of severe punishment for any deviation from the prescribed rules reinforces the
                        lack of agency and fosters a climate of fear and compliance.


                        The Illusion of Agency:
                        While women in Gilead are largely powerless, the novel also explores subtle forms of
                        resistance such as maintaining personal memories, relationships or acts of defiance.
                        The novel’s narration by Offred highlights the importance of language as a means of
                        resistance and maintaining a sense of self.
                        Even in the face of immense oppression, the characters hold on to a glimmer of hope for
                        escape and a future where they can exercise their agency.

                        The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood is a story about a woman named Offred in a scary future
                        where a strict religious group called Gilead rules America. Women have no freedom, and Offred is
                        a Handmaid, forced to have babies for a powerful man, the Commander, and his wife, Serena Joy.
                        She lives under tight control, always watched, and remembers her old life with her husband and
                        daughter, who were taken away. Offred carefully talks to other Handmaids and gets close to Nick,
                        the Commander’s driver, which is dangerous. She also learns about a secret group fighting
                        Gilead. When her actions are found out, she’s taken away, and we don’t know if she’s saved or in
                        trouble. The story, told by Offred, shows her struggle to stay strong in a cruel world.
